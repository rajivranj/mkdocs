# User Interface {#user-interface}

This chapter will provide you with a comprehensive guide on the main aspects of the SDMX Constructor’s user interface. It will cover three main topics. The first topic will be an overview of the user interface, including a detailed explanation of the various menu options and the working area. The second topic will focus on the inputs and outputs of SDMX Constructor. It will cover the different input and output options available. The third topic will provide an overview of the translation functionality in SDMX Constructor.

## General Functions Menu

In the top right corner (as highlighted below), the first group of buttons (General Functions) shows the items applicable to the whole tool. They include Reset, Support, Locale and Registry. See Table 3.1 for a brief overview of the menu items.

: (#tab:table33) A bird's-eye view of the menu items in the Editor Ribbon

If a user chooses "Codelist" from the top menu, the corresponding menu items in the third group will appear as "Load from registry" (from the dropdown menu), "Refresh the registry", "Import", "Reset the current Editor inputs", "Translation Service", and "Bulk load".

However, suppose a user selects "ConceptScheme" from the top menu instead. In that case, the user will see three additional options: "Add New Concept", "Load Concept", and "Delete Selected Concepts" relevant to the chosen menu item at the top, i.e., "ConceptScheme".

All options available within this menu group per the item selected on the top menu are listed below.

```{r 032, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/image032.png")
```

## Preview and Export Menu

The fourth menu item group (Preview and Export) is in the top right corner and below the first group of menu items (as highlighted below).

```{r 034, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/image034.png")
```
[Click here to enlarge the image](images/image034.png)

The options available in this group of menu items are related to the preview and export functionalities of the tool and change according to the menu item selected on the top menu (the second group of menu items (Editors)).

Below are the icons representing the menu items, along with their features. Users can change the size of these icons by right-clicking on any of them, selecting Customize, and selecting the appropriate setting in Options.

| Menu item                  | Names and functions                                                              
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ![](images/image036.png)   | Export. It saves the SDMX artefact in a local folder. It is available for DSD, Dataflow, ContentConstraint, AgencyScheme, and MSD without specific options. However, options are available to save artefacts from: 1. Codelist (available in the following formats: .Stat v7 Dim, CSV and SDMX-ML) and 2. ConceptScheme, Table Modeller and CategoryScheme (available in two flavours: Save with descendants and Save without descendants).                                                                                       |
| ![](images/image037.png) <br> or <br> ![](images/image038.png)   | Push to DLM (DLM is short for Data Lifecycle Manager of the .Stat Suite). This icon becomes active (appears with colours) when the tool is connected with a DLM instance. It is available for Codelist, DSD, Dataflow, ContentConstraint, AgencyScheme, and MSD without specific options. However, options are available to save artefacts from ConceptScheme, Table Modeller and CategoryScheme.         
| ![](images/image039.png)   | Structure Viewer. It lets you preview the tabulation and download the MS Excel and CSV templates. It is available for DSD and Dataflow.                                                                                             |

## Working area

The following section explains the working area of the tool.

Below the menu items on top, the user interface appears divided into two main parts. First, the left pane on the interface serves as a space to hold the artefacts' list. The other side is designated to showcase relevant details (both sides are highlighted in different colours in the screenshot below). Selecting (by double-clicking) an artefact from the left pane prompts its details to appear on the screen's right-side pane. This layout is available for Codelist, Dataflow and ContentConstraint.

```{r 040, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/image040.png")
```
[Click here to enlarge the image](images/image040.png)

For ConceptScheme, Table Modeller, DSD, AgencyScheme, CategoryScheme, and MSD, an additional pane also appears in the user interface (below the placeholder for listing the artefacts - (as highlighted below)), which acts as a staging area (or a pool). It becomes a CONCEPTS POOL for ConceptScheme, Table Modeller, DSD and MSD options. And it turns into an AGENCY POOL for AgencyScheme and a CATEGORY POOL for CategoryScheme options.

The users can drag the artefacts back and forth between the pool area and the pane on the right.

```{r 042, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

## Input and output methods

Users can input information into SDMX Constructor in several ways, depending on the specific scenarios. The following are the options. 

-	Typing and copy-pasting: Users can enter information by typing text or copying and pasting into fields in the forms using a keyboard.
-	Clicking: Users can interact with buttons, links, menus, or other graphical elements by clicking with a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen. For example, double-clicking an artefact from the left pane load its details on the screen’s right-side pane.
-	Dragging and dropping: Users can manipulate objects or select multiple items by dragging and dropping them with a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen.
-	Loading from online SDMX Registry: Users can access pre-prepared SDMX artefacts from many default online SDMX registries. The input method allows users to retrieve information from the SDMX registry.

SDMX Constructor presents information to users in a standardised and user-friendly way, using a combination of graphical elements, form-based input and validation and error messages. 

-	Graphical interface: The SDMX Constructor uses a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the metadata components using visual elements like buttons, menus, and icons. This makes it easy for users to navigate and manipulate the metadata and get a quick overview of the SDMX artefacts.
-	Form-based input: The SDMX Constructor uses form-based input screens to allow users to enter information about the metadata components. The forms are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear labels, dropdown menus, and text boxes that guide users through the input process.
-	Validation and error messages: The SDMX Constructor validates the metadata components to ensure that they conform to the SDMX standard and are consistent with other components. If there are errors or inconsistencies, the tool provides error messages that help users identify and correct the issues.

## Translation

SDMX Constructor allows users to manage multilingual metadata components easily. Users can choose from automatic or manual translation methods and edit translations using translation tables. The tool simplifies the translation process with standardised language codes and automation and helps users achieve accurate, high-quality translations.

Here are some tool features supporting the translation of SDMX artefacts:

-	Translation into three languages: The tool supports translating content into three languages of your choice. It helps by following two automatic methods, but you can always do it manually if required.
-	Automatic translation methods: Using the Google Translate API key, you can connect with Google’s translation services. Another automated way is using DeepL. The SDMX Constructor allows programmatic access to DeepL’s machine translation technology, bringing high-quality translation capabilities directly to the tool.
-	Translation tables: Using these API keys, the SDMX Constructor provides translation tables, which allow users to edit suggested translations of metadata components in different languages. You can enter translations for different language codes, and the tool will automatically populate the translations in the appropriate fields.
-	Standardised language codes: The SDMX Constructor uses standardised language codes; users can select from a list of pre-defined language codes.
