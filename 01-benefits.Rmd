# Benefits of SDMX Constructor {#benefits-of}

SDMX Constructor is a software tool that offers a range of features and functionalities designed to streamline and optimise the SDMX workflow, making it an essential tool for statistical organisations, data providers, and other stakeholders involved in the production and dissemination of statistical data.

One of the key benefits of SDMX Constructor is that it allows users to access and query SDMX structural artefacts from SDMX registries (through APIs in the background) in a desktop environment. This makes it easy for users to quickly and easily search for and view essential components of SDMX structural metadata, such as Data Structure Definitions (DSDs) and dataflows.

In addition to its API capabilities, SDMX Constructor offers two other essential features. The first is that it helps users model data following the SDMX standards. For example, SDMX Constructor makes it easy for users to define data structures and create data flows following SDMX standards. This is essential for data providers who need easy-to-use tools to ensure that their data can be shared and used by others in a consistent and standardised way.

The second essential feature of SDMX Constructor is that it enables users to create and edit SDMX artefacts in a user-friendly environment. This includes creating and editing code lists, concept schemes, DSDs, dataflows, content constraints, category schemes and Metadata Structure Definitions (MSDs)[^index-5]. SDMX Constructor provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to create and modify these artefacts without needing to be an expert in SDMX.

[^index-5]: These SDMX terms are detailed in the SDMX Glossary, available on the official SDMX website. The SDMX Glossary is a comprehensive reference guide that provides definitions and explanations for all the key terms and concepts used in SDMX. You can access the SDMX Glossary by visiting the following link: https://sdmx.org/?sdmx_news=sdmx-glossary.

Finally, SDMX Constructor supports data availability and access through online data portals. Using SDMX Constructor, data providers can ensure their data is available and accessible through online data portals built on SDMX standards. This allows data users to easily access and use the data they need for their research, analysis, and other activities.
